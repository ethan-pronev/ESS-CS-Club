# Erindale CS Club - Competitive Programming in C++
Repository for many of my solutions to DMOJ problems.
Also contains powerpoint lessons used for teaching concepts in competitive programming.
Includes problems from:
  CCC/CCO,
  DMOPC,
  ECOO,
  DMPG,
  and others.

For my own reference, students in the Erindale CS club, or anyone else interested in competitive programming.

Note: I do not claim ownership of everything in this repository, in particular the powerpoint under "Powerpoints-PET.CS". All the code has been typed by myself however.
